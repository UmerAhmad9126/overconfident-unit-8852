            <h1>Top Fruit Safety Tips You Should Be Swearing By Every Time You Consume Them .</h1>
            <p>By Kimaye Fruits</p>
            <p> Fresh fruits bring with them a horde of health benefits, but it’s the way we consume them that is more
                important. While fruits have the ability to prevent many diseases such as cancer, heart stroke, not
                washing them properly can give rise
                to a number of health problems that might turn into deadly diseases. So we bring to you some topfruit
                safety tips that will come in handy every time you sit down to consume them.<br> 1. Pick produce that is
                not bruised or spoiled. Any
                opening in the fruit is actually a haven for pathogenic bacteria during the transit.<br> 2. Fruits that
                are spiralized or pre-cut must be refrigerated or should be stored in the refrigerator! If you really
                need to buy pre-cut fruits, be
                sure to refrigerate them right after you cut them.<br> 3. Ensure that you separate fruits from raw meat,
                poultry, and seafood in the shopping cart, in the grocery bags, and in the kitchen.<br> 4. Clean all the
                fruits before cutting or
                eating. Don’t wash them in case of packaged fruits, where the packaging says the contents have been
                washed.<br> 5. Keep the fruits inside the packet in which it was bought from the vendor. Further, the
                packet should be kept in an isolated
                place for some time before it can be brought into use.<br> 6. In case of some fruits where you the peel
                are not eaten, thoroughly rinse produce under running water so that the germs do not get inside the
                surface when you cut or eat them.<br> 7. Cut the fruits as close as possible to the time you’ll be
                consuming them.<br> 8. Make sure to use a sharp cutting knife, and clean it well before cutting the
                fruits.<br> 9. Refrigerate fruits you have cut or peeled within 2 hours (or
                1 hour if the room temperature is 90°or warmer). Chill them at 40°F or colder in a clean container.<br>
                10. Do not use disinfecting sprays, cleaning wipes or soap on fresh produce, as this can harm its
                quality and the nutrients the fruit
                has to offer. Only fresh water should be used in the cleaning of fresh fruits.
